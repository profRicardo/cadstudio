# Deployment Restrictions
version: 1.0.0

## Function Deployment

### NEVER Deploy Functions
- **NEVER** run `supabase functions deploy` commands
- **NEVER** run `npx supabase functions deploy` commands
- **NEVER** attempt to deploy any Supabase Edge Functions
- **NEVER** suggest or recommend deploying functions

### Local Development Only
- All function testing should be done locally with `supabase functions serve`
- Use local Supabase instance for development and testing
- Function deployment is exclusively the responsibility of the human developer

### Code Changes Only
- AI assistant should only:
  - Modify function code
  - Update type definitions
  - Make local code changes
  - Run type checks
  - Test locally if needed

### Deployment Handoff
- After making function changes, simply inform the user that:
  - The code changes are complete
  - Function deployment is required for the changes to take effect
  - The user needs to deploy manually when ready

## Rationale
- Production deployments require human oversight
- Deployment credentials should not be accessed by AI
- Local testing is sufficient for development workflow
- Human developer maintains control over when and what gets deployed
